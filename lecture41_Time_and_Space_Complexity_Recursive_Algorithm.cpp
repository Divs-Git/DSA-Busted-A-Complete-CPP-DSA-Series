//Time required as function of input f(n) is time complexity
//we can solve time complexity by using expression or Recursion tree

//Linear Search 
//Time Complexity :- O(n);
//Space Complexity:- O(1); 


//Recursion:-

//Time complexity of Factorial : O(n)

//TC of Binary search :- O(logn)

//TC of Merge Sort :- O(logn)

//TC of Fibonacci series :- O(2^n) => exponential time complexity
//exponential time complexity is very ghatiya

//space complexity :- Space required as function of input f(n)
//Maxm space required at any instant of time in the graph

//factorial SC        => O(n)
