//Q2. Lowest common Ancestor in a Binary Tree
//https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-in-a-binary-tree/1

//Q3. K sum path == HW. find the TC & SC?
// https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-sum-paths/1

//Q4. Ancestor of the kth https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/kth-ancestor-in-a-tree/1
//solved by two approach 1.-> traversing and storing all the nodes in a vector inorder to find a given node
//                       2.-> solved using recursion by keeping an important condn. as edge case in mind watch soln on gfg

//Q5. Max sum of non-adjacent nodes https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-sum-of-non-adjacent-nodes/1
//approach => we make a pair<int a, int b>  where a is the max sum by including the current element nodes and b is the max sum by excluding the current element node
